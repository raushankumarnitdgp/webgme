The Scope of this Tutorial
===========================
This tutorial will guide you on how to build a Design Studio with webgme. If both of these terms are completely new to you,
that's fine. It will also explain what these are.

Target Audience
----------------
This is for you, a researchers or engineer, who might have seen an example of an application build up in webgme and are interested
in building your application fitting your domain.

Who else?

Prerequisites
-------------
Although we try to explain the `underlying technologies that webgme depend on <dependencies.rst>`_,
users are assumed to have a basic understanding of these. If not it's recommended to use the internet and read up on the basics
behind these technologies. In addition it's required that you have some experience in JavaScript, HTML5 and CSS3. It should be noted that unless
you really need to customize the visualization, JavaScript will suffice.
