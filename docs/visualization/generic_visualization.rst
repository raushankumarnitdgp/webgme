Generic Visualization
======================
Webgme comes packages with a range of different visualization components. These are meta-agnostic and can be applied to
any meta-models. Based on the current meta-model the visualizers adapt to themselves and displays only what is possible
to do within the meta-model. For instance the property-editor does not the user set a value for an attribute that does not
have a definition in the meta-model. Another example is the part-browser, it only display the valid children of the active
node.
