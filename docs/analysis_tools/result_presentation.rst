Result Presentation
======================
There are multiple ways results from an analysis can be presented to the user. Initially it depends on the type of analysis
that is performed. For simplicity here, we will assume that the analysis result can be presented in a graph or table.

Generate a graphical representation from the plugin
------------------------------------
The most straight-forward way to present to present the results is to generate a graphical representation from the plugin
or analysis tool and return a link to this artifact at the end of the execution.

Store the final result in the model

Update the model as the results are generated
