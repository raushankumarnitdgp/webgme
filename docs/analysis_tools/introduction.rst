Analysis Tools
======================
Whereas it is feasible for an interpreter to perform an analysis on its own - in a lot of applications
the analysis is a performed by a separate program (could be a third-party tool). Typically it is the plugin that
handles the triggering and monitoring of the analysis tool. The plugin also handles the result feedback to the modeller.

Depending on the type of analysis, the expected load on a deployment and requirements on result visualization, webgme offers
a couple of different built in options for handling the analysis.
