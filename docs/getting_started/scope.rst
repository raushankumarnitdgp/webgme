The Scope of this Tutorial
===========================
This tutorial is targeted towards people who are new to webgme. Although we try to explain the underlying technologies,
users are assumed to have a basic understanding of mongodb, node.js and web-development. If not it's recommended to use
the internet and read up on the basics behind these technologies. In addition it's required that you have some experience
in JavaScript, HTML5 and CSS3. It should be noted that unless you really need to customize the visualization, JavaScript
will suffice.
