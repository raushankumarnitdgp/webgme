The Scope of this Tutorial
===========================
This tutorial will guide you on how to build a Design Studio with webgme.

What is a Design Studio?
------------------------
A framework with a set of tools and services for simplifying one or many (typically engineering) tasks.

Typical components of a design studio include
* A domain (meta-model) for building models
* Model interpreters typically targeting analysis tools
* Interfaces/services towards (third party) analysis tools
* Visualization for modeling and viewing analysis results
* Version controlled models and centralized storage

Prerequisites
-------------
Although we try to explain the `underlying technologies that webgme depend on<getting_started/dependencies.rst>`_,
users are assumed to have a basic understanding of these. If not it's recommended to use the internet and read up on the basics
behind these technologies. In addition it's required that you have some experience in JavaScript, HTML5 and CSS3. It should be noted that unless
you really need to customize the visualization, JavaScript will suffice.
